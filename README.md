# Dev Config

The files within this repo are the config files for how I like my shell/terminal/workspace. Use at your own risk.

## Resources

* Current oh-my-posh theme: https://github.com/craftzdog/dotfiles-public/blob/master/.config/powershell/takuya.omp.json
* Much of the initial PowerShell profile is comes from Takuya Matsuyama's video: https://youtu.be/5-aK2_WwrmM
  * Oh My Posh is installed via winget, so no need to import the module for use in PowerShell
